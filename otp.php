<?php
//this page is only the otp confirmation page
//check how you can get the otp from the backend to here to confirm it with the user's input
//there should be a session var here that increments when user enters the otp
//if user enters incorrectly, we should land back to the samme page
//if the incorrect inputs reach 3 times, then land back the user to the registration page
//there will be a back button with which the user can go back to the registration page with all the details intact from last session

//now, here the admin will also be tested on login, so check if the session variable is having admin as the user or other users are coming in
